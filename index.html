        <p>After dying a laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a game, high school student and recluse Kazuma
        Satou finds himself sitting before a beautiful but obnoxious goddess named Aqua. She provides the NEET with two options:
        continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream—a real fantasy world! Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma
        is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villages. But before he goes, he can choose one item of
        any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistake—Aqua is
        completely useless!</p>

          <p>Yearning to make friends and perform live with a band, lonely and socially anxious Hitori "Bocchi" Gotou devotes her
          time to playing the guitar. On a fateful day, Bocchi meets the outgoing drummer Nijika Ijichi, who invites her to join
          Kessoku Band when their guitarist, Ikuyo Kita, flees before their first show. Soon after, Bocchi meets her final
          bandmate—the cool bassist Ryou Yamada.
          
          Although their first performance together is subpar, the girls feel empowered by their shared love for music, and they
          are soon rejoined by Kita. Finding happiness in performing, Bocchi and her bandmates put their hearts into improving as
          musicians while making the most of their fleeting high school days.</p>

          <p>Shinji Ikari is left emotionally comatose after the death of a dear friend. With his son mentally unable to pilot the
          humanoid robot Evangelion Unit-01, Gendou Ikari's NERV races against the shadow organization SEELE to see who can enact
          their ultimate plan first. SEELE desires to create a godlike being by fusing their own souls into an Evangelion unit,
          while Gendou wishes to revert all of humanity into one primordial being so that he can be reunited with Yui, his
          deceased wife.
          
          SEELE unleashes its military forces in a lethal invasion of NERV headquarters. As SEELE's forces cut down NERV's
          scientists and security personnel, Asuka Langley Souryuu pilots Evangelion Unit-02 in a desperate last stand against
          SEELE's heaviest weaponry.
          
          The battle rages on, and a depressed Shinji hides deep within NERV's headquarters. With the fate of the world resting in
          Shinji's hands, Captain Misato Katsuragi hunts for the teenage boy as society crumbles around them.</p>
